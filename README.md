For Java Project, run the MazeApp.java file. Load button in upper left corner lets you choose a variety of preloaded mazes. And a text box on the right hand side lets you make a custom maze generated through Prim's formulation given a specific height and width as a comma seperated value. The progressive solve checkbox on top lets you see how each solving algorithm works differently from the others, and a speed slider lets you control how fast the program runs.

For the CPP program I just made a simple program that finds the absolute value of any number that you give it.
